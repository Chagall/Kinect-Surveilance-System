List of things to do (Not ordered by priority).

- For each one of them a new issue will 'hopefully' be opened.

1 - Research more about OpenKinect (Biggest issue)
    1.1 - Learn how the 'libfreenect' deals with each of the kinect cameras. 
          That is, to which of the cameras the library actually has support.
    1.2 - Learn how to develop a simple program to move the kinect motors up and down.
          - Issues related to this: 
            - Apparently if the kinect is not on the vertical position the motors won't respond
              accordingly. (Need to see if this is really the case).
    1.3 - Learn how to develop a simple program that takes a screenshoot of all possible
          usable kinect cameras.
    1.4 - Learn how to develop a simple program that records the video stream from all possible
          usable kinect cameras.
          - Issues related to this: 
            - What are the possible video formats avaiable for recording? The choosen format must
              have a good quality/size ratio (possible mkv, mp4 or something related).
    1.5 - Learn if it is possible, and if so, how to watch the kinect video streaming from another device.
          In this case, the device I was planning to watch from was and Moto G 1st generation smartphone.
    1.6 - Learn if it is possible, and if so, how to calculate the distance between the kinect 
          sensor and someone inside the room.
      
2 - Drawings
    2.0 - Draw the case prototype which will hold the Moto G in my arm.
    2.1 - Draw the case prototype which will hold the Kinect on the wall.
          - Issues related to this:
            - Where in the room the Kinect would be placed.
    2.2 - Draw the case prototype which will hold the notebook on the wall.
          - Issues related to this:
            - Is it really necessary to hold the notebook on the wall?
              It can be placed on my desk.

3 - Building the cases
    3.0 - I still need to decide wheter or not I'm going to build them or pay/ask
          someone to do it for me.

3 - Sensors:
    - Sensors to keep in mind: Luminosity, Temperature, Humidity. (Add more if I remmember/discover another)
    - I think I could easily buy them here in my city.
    - Ok, the whole idea of adding sensors to the play is nice, but how will they communicate with my notebook?
      That is indeed a big issue. I think I would need to use a protoboard or an arduino, raspbery pi, beaglebone black.
    - The luminosity sensor would be used to determine wheter the room's lights are turned on or off.
        In case the lights are on: The app would receive the video stream from the normal camera.
        In case the lights are off: The app would receive the video stream from the 'proximity' camera.
          Because: We can't see any shit in the dark!
      
4 - Android application:
    - Ok, this is a big issue too, since I don't know yet how to develop an android app.
    - The app idea is: 
        The kinect sensor is connected to the notebook
        The notebook is connected to the internet
        The notebook streams the video captured by the kinect to the app in real time
        as well as the information provided by the sensors, displaying all of them in the phone screen.
        The stream would be avaiable to anyone who had the access right to watch it.
